# Construction Building Management System (BMS) Specification

## Overview
The Construction Building Management System (BMS) is a comprehensive module for NextGenBuildPro that handles all aspects of building management for construction projects. This includes building information modeling, materials management, inspection tracking, and compliance monitoring.

## Core Components

### 1. Building Information Module
- 3D modeling integration
- Floor plan management
- Structural component tracking
- MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing) systems management

### 2. Materials Management
- Inventory tracking
- Material ordering and procurement
- Usage monitoring
- Waste reduction analytics

### 3. Inspection and Compliance
- Inspection scheduling
- Compliance checklist management
- Code violation tracking
- Permit management

### 4. Building Performance
- Energy efficiency monitoring
- Sustainability metrics
- Building systems performance analytics
- Maintenance scheduling

## Integration Points
- CRM Module: Connect building information to client requirements
- PM Module: Link building components to project tasks and timelines
- Service Module: Connect maintenance requirements to service scheduling

## Technical Requirements
- Real-time 3D rendering capabilities
- BIM (Building Information Modeling) compatibility
- IoT sensor integration for building monitoring
- Mobile-friendly interface for on-site inspections

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Create a BmsModule similar to existing CrmModule and PmModule
2. Implement repositories for building data, materials, and inspections
3. Develop viewmodels for each major component
4. Create UI screens for building management, materials, and inspections
5. Integrate with existing modules through the ModuleManager
